# Sinusoidal-Generator
In this project, I have written a LUT based code to generate sine or cose wave based on the type of the digital input it receives. For 1 the waveform comes out to be same. But then when a 0 comes, then based on bipolar conditions we get 180 degree phase shifted signal. At the these consecutive two bits get added as signed integer and stored.
