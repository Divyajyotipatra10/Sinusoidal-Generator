# Sinusoidal-Generator
In this project, I have written a LUT based code to generate sine or cose wave based on the type of the digital input it receives. For 1 the waveform comes out to be same. But then when a 0 comes, then based on bipolar conditions we get 180 degree phase shifted signal. At the these consecutive two bits get added as signed integer and stored.
Example output has been attached below:-
